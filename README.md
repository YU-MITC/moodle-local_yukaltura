# YU Kaltura Media Package
"YU Kaltura Media Package" is a third-party's Kaltura plugin package for Moodle 2.9 or later. This package is developed by the Media and Information Technology Center, Yamaguchi University. By using this package, users can upload media to the Kaltura server, and easily embed the media in Moodle courses. Moreover, this package provides some useful functions. Since this package does not require Kaltura Application Framework (KAF), can work with Kaltura Community Edition (CE) and other editions.

Please note that there is a chance this module will not work on some Moodle environment. Also, this package is only available in English. Stay tuned to future versions for other language supports.

Original plugin package ("Kaltura Video Package") has better functions than ours and is easy to use. So that, for customers of the "Kaltura SaaS Edition", use the original plugin package is the better.
